This repository was created to share some programming tasks that I've been developing on university. I have been developed projetcts in those areas: 
* [Communication Systems Software Prototyping](https://github.com/fellipe-leandro/fellipe_DCO2004)
* [Digital Image Processing](https://fellipe-leandro.github.io/PDI/index.html)
* [x86 Assembly Programming](https://fellipe-leandro.github.io/arquitetura/arc_index.html)

I also contributed to develop content for a PIC-Programming short-course, that is available at:
