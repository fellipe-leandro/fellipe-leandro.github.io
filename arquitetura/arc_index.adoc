This page is about the projects that I'm developing on x86 Assembly language to the class of Computer Architecture and Programming.


* link:senha_tasm.html[Tasm Project] - First Application developed on TASM environment.
* link:/projeto_final/main.asm [Final Project] - Using the FRESH IDE (https://fresh.flatassembler.net/), 
we developed a PDI application that is capable of generates the negative of a 
image and make a steganography process (hide a image 'inside' the other and recover it wiht a minimum of distortion).
The executable of the code can be found in the directory *projeto_final/main*
